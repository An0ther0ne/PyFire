# PyFire
This is my research about implementation fire effect.
I wanted to find the simplest and fastest realization that effect with python and pygame.
Unfortunate, operations with separate pixels in the pygame too slow.
You can verify this yourself by running the regular version of program:
	python fireg.py

And as you can see, it work very very slowly:
